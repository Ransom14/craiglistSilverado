Getting rid of my beautiful ride because my employer is providing a truck for me. This White Diamond truck was custom ordered with all the options! Boasts the powerful and fuel-efficient 6.2 liter V8 engine so its ready to haul wherever you need to go! The Custom BORLA exhaust from factory gives this truck that quiet but throaty Corvette sound! With it's well-built and comfortable interior of the 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 High Country this quiet ride is something for everybody. It is fully fit out with Weather-Tech containment matting through the whole cab! The box is fit out with spray in bed liner and tonneau cover. This one in particular is in impeccable condition (interior AND exterior!) having been a garage-kept vehicle! Brand new tires just installed! For information on this please email or text me at Five oh 7 - two08-five four zero 4

Stainless Steel Bully Nerf Bars. Removed from my 2003 2500HD Silverado extended cab pickup. These mount directly to cab mounts and brace to the frame of your pickup. Steel brackets are rusty but still strong, and could be cleaned up and painted if you would like. Bars are stainless steel, not not just steel with chrome finish, so still very strong. These are not rusted out like black or chrome finished bars do. Looks like these should fit 99-2011 GM 1500 or 2500 extended cab pickups and maybe even crew cab pickups. If you have a crew cab-call me and I'll measure overall length and distance between cab mounts.

I am regretfully selling this beast to buy something more family oriented. Okay that being said now about the truck.
2011 Chevy Silverado LTZ 2500 HD with the 6.0 vortec gas engine. The truck has 62,xxx miles and that will go up as its my daily driver. It has a BDS 6.5 inch suspension lift with 37x13.50x18 inch Toyo Open country Tires on Fuel wheels. This thing turns heads that's for sure!
Also has Bushwacker fender flares also has a spray in bed liner and a soft tonneau cover. 

Inside it has just about every option Chevy offered for that year including the Bose Premium sound system with a sub-woofer in the center counsel! Heated Leather Seats, adjustable pedals, key less entry and factory remote start, Reverse camera in the mirror.

 The exterior of the truck has a couple of minor scratches no dings or dents. The bed of the truck is also in perfect condition inside and out.  under the hood is equally spotless. The interior is flawless not a mark in the leather no stains on the carpet and no scratches in the plastic. This truck has never seen a day of work and has never been off road she's a pavement baby. It drives down the road straight as an arrow has no slop in the steering. Like I said it has been babied and well taken care of. I forgot to mention there is one negative about the truck the chrome is starting to come off the center of the rim on all 4 tires. I'm not sure if it can be repaired but it actually looks like its supposed to be like it is it's hard to explain without seeing it in person.

I am not being forced to sell so please no low ball offers! This truck is in near mint shape and has low miles so I am expecting the same in any trade offers!

Please contact me with questions or more pictures or to set up a time to come and check this thing out I promise you wont be disappointed!

Now on to what I would like. I would be interested in a PARTIAL trade for a All wheel drive  luxury car/suv Mercedes, BMW, Lexus, Infiniti  excetra...  Let me know what you have and maybe we can make a deal! 

There is a small lien on the truck which will be taken care of at time of sale I have title in hand.

Has salvage title from what I was told was due to a break in and the truck was stolen, no idea if that's truly the case however I don't care it doesn't affect my insurance so I find it irrelevant.

Pros

New rim and tire set ($3K) right as winter ended

Brakes and Rotors done about 7-8 months ago got the nicest ones they had.

Loud dual 45 exhaust 

New aftermarket tail lights

New led light bar ( red running and brake lights, amber signal lights and white reverse lights)

New rear HD rear differential was put in when the tires got put on and runs like butter

Double Din touchscreen radio

New Z71 equivalent shocks put in all 4

Looks as though it's had engine work done but was done by last owner so not sure.

New bosch batter put in a year ago

Rust just starting on rocker panels

New bushwhacker fender flares installed 

Cold A/C and Hot Heat

Full synthetic oil every 3500

Mostly all highway miles

Truck is solid, reliable and clean is not perfect but it's a beast

Cons

Has airbag light on, I haven't even looked into it because I could personally careless

Sticky doors/handles just the back two doors either need the weather seal replaced and or the handles themselves they both open and shut just annoying is all.

Last thing is the ac has 5 settings and it doesn't blow on the highest every other setting works no problem.

All these listed are small annoyances and don't affect the truck whatsoever. Therefore that's why they haven't been taken care of yet. I bought the truck a year ago for 5,500 and since have put close to 12K into the truck. Again the truck ain't perfect but it's pretty close and the only reason I'm selling is I need another excursion and or a suburban for work. Will be rebuilding the front end within a month or two if I don't sell. I would be down to trade depending.

I am selling my 2001 Chevy Silverado 1500 LT. It runs perfect. I haven't had a single issue with it. It starts great at -20 degrees and stays cool at 100 degrees. Everything works great. Ac/ heat, you name it.  I would love to keep this truck but I have to sell it because I can't have a vehicle for my first year of college. The interior is leather and is in great condition except for a small patch on the side of the driver's seat(covered by a leather seat cover). Also, the glove box tab is broken off, but that could easily be replaced or just keep your items in the large center console. Feel free to come check out the truck, but I can't sell it to you until early to mid August. Well maintained: scheduled oil changes, fluid checks, alignments, greased bearings, and frequent washes.

Selling my grandpa's 2007 Chevy Silverado Classic. It has the 5.3l V8 Flex fuel engine. My grandpa has owned it since around 100k miles. The truck now has 196k miles and runs great. Just took it up to the border of Canada for fishing opener and not a single issue. Has push button 4wd as well. Only small issues are it is rusty (Welcome to MN), the abs and the brake light are on. Other than that it has good tires, drives straight, shifts good, and runs great! Asking $4,500 cash. Call or text me with any questions.
